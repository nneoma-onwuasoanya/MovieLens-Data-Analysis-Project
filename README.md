# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on MovieLens-Dataset
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In this project stage, i successfully explored user behaviour, movie ratings, and trends to lay a foundationn for building a movie recommendation system. I merged disparate data sources and created new columns to enrich the information available for each user-movie interaction using python.This helped inform future model-building strategies and to understand how users interact with movies over time.

### Problem Statement
Understanding user preferences and behavior is crucial for building an effective movie recommendation system. This analysis will help answer questions like:

What factors influence how users rate movies?

Do multi-genre movies get higher ratings than single-genre movies?

When do users engage with the platform most?



### Methodology

The Data was extracted and cleaned using python

Several new features were derived using python

Visualization was created to analyze user behaviour, rating patterns , and the impact of genres on movie ratings.
